### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow .github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement .copilot-tracking/plans/20260107-vue3-pinia-firebase-setup-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions

**CRITICAL**: If ${input:phaseStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If ${input:taskStop:false} is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from .copilot-tracking/changes/20260107-vue3-pinia-firebase-setup-changes.md to the user:

   - You WILL keep the overall summary brief
